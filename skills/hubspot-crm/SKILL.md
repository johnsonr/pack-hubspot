description: HubSpot CRM workflows — finding/creating/updating contacts, companies, deals, and tickets; searching by property; listing owners; navigating pipelines and stages; and linking objects via associations. Activate this skill BEFORE making any HubSpot call when the user asks anything involving contacts, companies, deals, tickets, sales pipeline, account owners, or anything in HubSpot.

# HubSpot CRM Workflows

## Namespace

Calls go through `gateway.hubspot.<method>(args)` from inside `execute_javascript`
or `execute_python`. Never call them as top-level tools.

Methods are camelCase, args are camelCase too (HubSpot's own convention — different
from GitHub). Object types are passed as a string: `"contacts" | "companies" | "deals" | "tickets"`.
The same endpoints work for engagements (`"notes"`, `"tasks"`, `"calls"`, `"emails"`, `"meetings"`)
and custom object names.

If a call returns `gateway.hubspot.foo is not a workspace tool`, the error lists every valid
method — pick from it. Never re-send the same call.

## Cardinal rules

1. **Don't fabricate IDs.** Object IDs, owner IDs, pipeline/stage IDs — every one comes from a tool result.
2. **`properties` is `Map<String, String>`.** Even numeric fields (`amount`, `hs_object_id`) and dates come back as strings.
3. **Search before update.** HubSpot has no "lookup by email" endpoint — use `objectsSearch` with a property filter.
4. **Cap pagination.** Default `limit: 100` (the max). For "how many" use `objectsSearch` with `limit: 1` and read `total`.
5. **Confirm writes with the user.** `objectsCreate`, `objectsUpdate`, `objectsArchive` mutate live CRM data.

## Finding things

**Get by ID** — direct, cheap:

```javascript
const c = await gateway.hubspot.objectsGet({
  objectType: "contacts",
  objectId: "12345",
  properties: ["email", "firstname", "lastname", "company"],   // omit → returns default props only
});
console.log(c.properties.email);
```

**Find by property** (email, domain, name, custom field) — always uses `objectsSearch`:

```javascript
const r = await gateway.hubspot.objectsSearch({
  objectType: "contacts",
  filterGroups: [{ filters: [{ propertyName: "email", operator: "EQ", value: "alice@acme.com" }] }],
  properties: ["email", "firstname", "lastname", "hs_object_id"],
  limit: 1,
});
const contact = r.results[0];   // undefined if no match
```

**Counting** — `total` is in the search response. Don't list-and-count:

```javascript
const r = await gateway.hubspot.objectsSearch({
  objectType: "deals",
  filterGroups: [{ filters: [{ propertyName: "dealstage", operator: "EQ", value: "closedwon" }] }],
  limit: 1,
});
console.log(`Closed-won deals: ${r.total}`);
```

**Filter operators** — `EQ NEQ LT LTE GT GTE BETWEEN IN NOT_IN HAS_PROPERTY NOT_HAS_PROPERTY CONTAINS_TOKEN NOT_CONTAINS_TOKEN`.

**Multiple filter groups** are OR'd; filters within a group are AND'd. So `"deals owned by Alice OR Bob, value > 10k"` is two filter groups.

## Listing

```javascript
const r = await gateway.hubspot.objectsList({
  objectType: "deals",
  limit: 100,
  properties: ["dealname", "amount", "dealstage", "closedate"],
  archived: false,
});
// r is { results: [...], paging?: { next: { after: "...", link: "..." } } }
for (const d of r.results) console.log(d.id, d.properties.dealname);
```

Paginate with `after`:

```javascript
let after = undefined, all = [];
for (let page = 0; page < 5; page++) {                // hard cap
  const r = await gateway.hubspot.objectsList({ objectType: "contacts", limit: 100, after });
  all.push(...r.results);
  after = r.paging?.next?.after;
  if (!after) break;
}
```

## Creating

```javascript
const c = await gateway.hubspot.objectsCreate({
  objectType: "contacts",
  properties: {                     // strings only — even numbers/dates
    email: "alice@acme.com",
    firstname: "Alice",
    lastname: "Nguyen",
    company: "Acme",
  },
});
console.log(`Created contact ${c.id}`);
```

For deals, include `pipeline` and `dealstage` — get valid IDs from `pipelinesList`:

```javascript
const pipes = await gateway.hubspot.pipelinesList({ objectType: "deals" });
const sales = pipes.results.find(p => p.label === "Sales Pipeline");
const newStage = sales.stages.find(s => s.label === "New").id;

await gateway.hubspot.objectsCreate({
  objectType: "deals",
  properties: { dealname: "Acme — Q2 expansion", amount: "25000", pipeline: sales.id, dealstage: newStage },
});
```

## Updating

```javascript
await gateway.hubspot.objectsUpdate({
  objectType: "contacts",
  objectId: "12345",
  properties: { phone: "+1-415-555-0199", lifecyclestage: "customer" },
});
```

Only the properties you pass are touched. `objectsUpdate` returns the updated object.

## Archiving

```javascript
await gateway.hubspot.objectsArchive({ objectType: "contacts", objectId: "12345" });
// 204 No Content. The object is soft-deleted; pass `archived: true` to objectsList to see it.
```

## Owners

Used for assigning records to a specific HubSpot user. Owner IDs are NOT email addresses.

```javascript
const r = await gateway.hubspot.ownersList({ limit: 100 });
const alice = r.results.find(o => o.email === "alice@acme.com");
// then: properties: { hubspot_owner_id: String(alice.id) }
```

## Pipelines

Lists deal/ticket pipelines and their stages. Stage IDs are required for any
deal/ticket create/update that touches `dealstage`/`hs_pipeline_stage`.

```javascript
const pipes = await gateway.hubspot.pipelinesList({ objectType: "deals" });
for (const p of pipes.results) {
  console.log(`${p.label} (${p.id})`);
  for (const s of p.stages) console.log(`  → ${s.label} (${s.id})`);
}
```

## Associations (v4)

Linking a contact to a company, a deal to a contact, etc. Use the v4 endpoints —
v3 is deprecated for new work.

**Read existing associations:**

```javascript
const r = await gateway.hubspot.associationsGet({
  fromObjectType: "contacts",
  fromObjectId: "12345",
  toObjectType: "companies",
});
for (const a of r.results) console.log(`Linked to company ${a.toObjectId}`);
```

**Create a default association** (HubSpot picks the standard relationship type):

```javascript
await gateway.hubspot.associationsCreateDefault({
  fromObjectType: "contacts",
  fromObjectId: "12345",
  toObjectType: "companies",
  toObjectId: "67890",
});
```

For non-default association types (e.g. a custom "Decision Maker" link), pass
`associationTypes: [{ associationCategory: "USER_DEFINED", associationTypeId: 42 }]`
to `associationsCreate` (advanced — rarely needed in chat).

## Pitfalls

- Method names are **camelCase**; args are **camelCase**. HubSpot is consistent on both.
- `properties` always returns **strings** — `parseFloat(d.properties.amount)` if you need a number.
- Empty `properties` request → only `hs_object_id`, `createdate`, `lastmodifieddate` come back. Always pass the property list you need.
- **Object type strings are plural** for standard objects (`contacts`, not `contact`).
- `dealstage` / `hs_pipeline_stage` need a stage **ID** (e.g. `"appointmentscheduled"`), not the label.
- Owner ID is a **string**, even though it looks numeric. Wrap with `String(...)` when assigning.
- Search returns `{ total, results, paging }`; list returns `{ results, paging }` — no `total` on bare list.
- Rate limit (Private App): 100 req/10 sec. Don't hammer in tight loops — batch via `objectsSearch` instead.
